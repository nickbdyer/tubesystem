Station will deal with passengers entering and exiting the station. 

Carriage will deal with passengers boarding and alighting the carraige/train.

Carriage and station will share a module probably. PassengerHolder?!

Station knows if there is a train stopped there. 

Train knows what station it is at, and where it is going to.
